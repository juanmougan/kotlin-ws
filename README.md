# kotlin-ws
Spark and Kotlin sample project, based in [one of the examples](https://sparktutorials.github.io/2017/01/28/using-spark-with-kotlin.html), but converted to use Gradle instead of Maven.

The idea is to implement a JWT token using [this library](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt), and add it to a REST endpoint developed in Kotlin and Spark.
